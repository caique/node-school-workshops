## Description
This repository holds my solutions for [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) self-guided workshop [Learn You The Node.js For Much Win](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode) by [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg).

These solutions can help you to get through all 13 challenges but I encourage you to try pass by yourself before look into my code or someone else. If you need help feel free to contact me.

## Third-party Modules
Some external modules are required. Please run:

```
npm install bl
npm install strftime
npm install through2-map
```
