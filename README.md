# Node School Workshops Solutions by [Caique Rodrigues](http://caiquerodrigues.github.io)

## Description
This repository holds my solutions for [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) self-guided workshops.

Please read the README file of each workshop for specific instructions.

These solutions can help you to get through all challenges, but I encourage you to try pass by yourself before look into my code or someone else. If you need help or suggestion feel free to contact me.
